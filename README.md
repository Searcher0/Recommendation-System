# Recommendation-System
Using Jupyter Notebook within the Jupyter lab enviornment.
I will be using the Walmart Items dataset from PromptCloud on Kaggle. 
- Walmart Product Review Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/promptcloud/walmart-product-review-dataset?resource=download

*Python will be the main language used throughout this project

Goal:
Make a product recommendation system using the walmart products. Using content-based, collaborative filtering, hybrid, and multi-model recommendation system approaches to provide diverse recommendations.
